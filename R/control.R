#' For `extract`, this function can be used to output the model object, the
#' recipe (if used), or some components of either or both. When evaluated, the
#' function's sole argument has a fitted workflow If the formula method is used,
#' the recipe element will be `NULL`.
#'
#' The results of the `extract` function are added to a list column in the
#' output called `.extracts`. Each element of this list is a tibble with tuning
#' parameter column and a list column (also called `.extracts`) that contains
#' the results of the function. If no extraction function is used, there is no
#' `.extracts` column in the resulting object. See [tune_bayes()] for more
#' specific details.
#'
#' Note that for [collect_predictions()], it is possible that each row of the
#'  original data point might be represented multiple times per tuning
#'  parameter. For example, if the bootstrap or repeated cross-validation are
#'  used, there will be multiple rows since the sample data point has been
#'  evaluated multiple times. This may cause issues when merging the predictions
#'  with the original data.

#' Control aspects of the Bayesian search process
#'
#' @param verbose A logical for logging results as they are generated. Despite
#'   this argument, warnings and errors are always shown. If using a dark IDE
#'   theme, some logging messages might be hard to see. If this is the case,
#'   try setting the `tidymodels.dark` option with
#'   `options(tidymodels.dark = TRUE)` to print lighter colors.
#' @param no_improve The integer cutoff for the number of iterations without
#'   better results.
#' @param uncertain The number of iterations with no improvement before an
#'  uncertainty sample is created where a sample with high predicted variance is
#'  chosen (i.e., in a region that has not yet been explored). The iteration
#'  counter is reset after each uncertainty sample. For example, if `uncertain =
#'  10`, this condition is triggered every 10 samples with no improvement.
#' @param seed An integer for controlling the random number stream.
#' @param time_limit A number for the minimum number of _minutes_ (elapsed) that
#'   the function should execute. The elapsed time is evaluated at internal
#'   checkpoints and, if over time, the results at that time are returned (with
#'   a warning). This means that the `time_limit` is not an exact limit, but a
#'   minimum time limit.
#' @param extract An optional function with at least one argument (or `NULL`)
#'   that can be used to retain arbitrary objects from the model fit object,
#'   recipe, or other elements of the workflow.
#' @param save_pred A logical for whether the out-of-sample predictions should
#'   be saved for each model _evaluated_.
#' @param pkgs An optional character string of R package names that should be
#'   loaded (by namespace) during parallel processing.
